Odin Book Library Simulation is a JavaScript project that allows users to manage a virtual library. Users can add and delete books from the library's collection, simulating the process of managing a personal book collection.

## Features

- **Add Books:** Users can add new books to the library's collection by providing details.
- **Delete Books:** Users can remove books from the library's collection by **double clicking on the book's title**, effectively simulating the act of discarding unwanted books.
- **Book Listing:** The current collection of books is displayed, allowing users to see all the books in their library.
